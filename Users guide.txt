The C4 mixed pathway model users guide 

1.To use this model, first copy all the files to a directory, then run MATLAB and set the working directory to the directory where the codes are saved. 

2."C4Ini.m" defines initial values and parameters.

3."C4Vel.m" defines rate equations.

4."C4MB.m" defines differential equations

5.Run "C4Drive.m" to simulate the photosynthesis and metabolite concentration changes with time.

6.Run "C4DriveAI.m" to simulate the steady-state light curves.

7.Use the parameter "Pathway_type" in ‘C4model_input。txt’to change different mixtured models.
  0 normal NADP-ME type 
  1 Asp+Mal transport and ME type 
  2 Asp+Mal and PCK type 
  3 Asp+Mal and PCK+ME type 
  4 Asp and PCK only type
